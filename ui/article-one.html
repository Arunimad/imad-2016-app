              EZIO is an ancestor of Desmond Miles, the protagonist of most of the series' backstory, who experiences Ezio's life through a device unlocking hidden memories inside his DNA. First appearing in Assassin's Creed II, a young Ezio witnesses the execution of his father and brothers at the hands of Templar conspirators. After killing the man responsible for their deaths, Ezio begins a journey to avenge his family and free Italy from Templar control. While rebuilding the Assassin Order, Ezio breaks the Templar dominance in Italy, Spain, and the Ottoman Empire. In his later years, Ezio begins his search for Altaïr's library in Masyaf and helps restore the Ottoman Assassin Order. After discovering Altaïr's piece of Eden, he decides to retire from the Assassin order to live a more peaceful life. The character as such, his depiction, personality and development, as well as the chronicling of his entire life have received critical acclaim.
